This archive is actually an official fix for XFree86/OS2 which corrects
a certain bug in the device driver required for XFree86.

For fun, and as a bonus, I added one more feature to this driver which
could make it quite worthwhile for people who do not own or use XFree86/OS2
(info is at http://borneo.gmd.de/~veit/os2/xf86os2.html, BTW).

This feature has been named "death", in relation to the various programs 
under OS/2 that attempt to kill processes (kill, killem, killit, pmkill, and
others).

To take advantage of this feature, you must do the following things:

0. The fix is structured in a way that it fits into the XFree86/OS2 environment.
   However, to only use the "death" feature, you don't need to install
   any parts of XFree86 except the enclosed device driver.
   Users of XFree86 just unpack this archive in the root directory of the
   drive where the \XFree86 tree is located and reboot.

1. The device driver is located in this fix in \XFree86\lib\xf86sup.sys.
   Install it somewhere (e.g. in \os2\boot on your disk) and add a line

	DEVICE=\pathtothedriver\XF86SUP.SYS

   accordingly to your config.sys file and reboot.

2. \XFree86\src\death contains the sample "death.exe" process and a 
   "hard-to-kill" example process named pig.exe for testing the feature.
   It also contains the source code of these processes and an API to
   integrate the function in your own code. Consult the README file in
   this directory.

Have fun
